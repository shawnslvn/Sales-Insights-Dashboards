# Sales-Insights-Dashboards
In this project my company wanted an overall view of Sales from 2021-2024. Through our CRM SAGE100 and its Insights Module, I was able to gather all the sales data from the companies 4 branches. I wanted to break it up into 4 categories. 

1) Overall company wide look at sales
2) In-Person Branch Sales
3) Online sales via our 2 online stores and Amazon Storefront
4) Inbound phone call sales
