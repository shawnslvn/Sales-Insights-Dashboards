# Sales-Insights-Dashboards
In this project my company wanted an overall view of Sales from 2021-2024. Through our CRM SAGE100 and its Insights Module, I was able to gather all the sales data from the companies 4 branches. I wanted to break it up into 3 categories. 

1) In-Person Branch Sales
2) Online sales via our 2 online stores and Amazon Storefront
3) Inbound phone call sales

After gathering all the data due to technical problems I had to break them up into smaller files and combine them back together in Excel. Once I had the complete file I was able to import that into SQL. From there I was able to begin cleaning the data and making separate tables for the each of these 4 categories to analyze them all separately. Once the data cleaning and transforming was complete I uploaded the files into Tableau and began creating KPIs and tables for Dashboards. 

Once all the dashboards were complete I sat down with management and we discussed what we found and how this could be used going forward. The big takeaways from the meeting were that in this format we could easily visualize and see how we were doing compared to previous years, identify top customers within the branches, track our online platform performances, and determing which states were up next to begin collecting tax from for out of state sales.
